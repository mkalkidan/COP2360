Key words 
creating different types - classes
                         - Field variable in class or instance, also called an attribute
                         - allow differnt modifiers about access

static(can't change), public(can access it outside) internal new unsafe readonly volatile 
    these modifiers can be used for methods and attribute/field 
i can declare multiple fields togethr with smae modifiers different name and separate them with ,(comma)
Constants - const and all caps is more strong but they are like static readonly
DateTime is a data type!

- Methods - can return void or something and has parameter 
has modifiers 
Local methods method in method
Over loading methods - i have got differnt / multiple methods with in methods
meaning i have different version of the paramater but same method 
everyone will return the same format or nothing at all.

- Constructors- has always has name as the class name 
- Deconstructors - 
- Reference - talking about this instance itself - this
- Properties - they have logic going in them the modify a value passed but by calculating 
- Index in string
